# Module Four Notes 02: Cloud Economics and Billing 

## 4.01 Introduction 

•	Amazon Web Service’s ability to offer on-demand and pay-as-you-go payment model creates the ability to compete and optimize costs for it’s users. 

## 4.02 How do you pay for AWS? 

•	Pay-as-you-go pricing is similar to the way many people pay for home utilities like water and electricity where consumers pay for only the for the amount of resources used within a time frame. 

•	Advantage one is the ability to be adaptable with changes within a business without having to over commit to budgets and not missing capacity. 

•	Advantage two is that companies and users may focus on the things that matter such as innovation and invention rather than having to worry about over provisioning. 

•	Advantage three is that you can pay less with using more as there are discounts for increased usage. 

•	Advantage four is that users may invest in reserved capacity; these instances are AURI, PURI, & NURI. (All Upfront Reserved Instance, Partial Upfront Reserved Instance, No Upfront Reserved Instance)

## 4.03 Key Principles of Pricing

•	Three fundamental drivers of AWS costs are Compute, Storage, Outbound data transfer. 

•	AWS offers pricing models like:
    oOn demand: pay for compute or database capacity with no long term commitments.

   - Dedicated Instances: run in a virtual private cloud on single customer hardware.

   - Spot Instances: Amazon EC2 pricing mechanism letting users purchase spare computing capacity with no upfront payment. 

   - Reservations: opportunity to receive greater discount by paying ahead of time for capacity.

## 4.07 What is IT Infrastructure? 

•	IT Infrastructure are required components to operate and manage enterprise IT environments; they are deployed in both cloud computing systems and on-site facilities. 

•	Components include:
o	Hardware: Facilities like server, datacenter, computers, routers, and items that cool, house, and power a datacenter. 
o	Software: the applications used by businesses and consist of the “OS-like Linux” which is responsible for connecting and managing all the software and physical resources. 
o	Networking: enables network operations, management, & communication between both internal and external systems. (Internet connectivity, firewalls, security, & hardware like router, switches, and cables)

•	Traditional infrastructures are expensive and require large amounts of hardware having to be managed by the owner on-site. 

•	Cloud infrastructure can be rented or created privately making it an affordable resource. 

## 4.08 What is a Data Center? 
“A google search, a YouTube video, a connected Nest device, and hundreds of Google cloud services all give you a response in a fraction of a second. What really happens when you click search or send a request? Your message travels over the public internet and into Google’s global fiber network. Millions of these requests or packets of data travel through miles of cable over land and under sea, converging at one of many data centers operated all over the world. “- Stephanie Wong

## 4.10 What is the Total Cost of Ownership 

•	TCO is a formula that assess direct and indirect cost and benefits of all IT components and is much tougher to scale than it may seem. 

•	TCO of cloud computing is domain dependent regarding weather the companies use is private or public. 

•	The ability IT cloud computing can adapt and shift with the business. 

•	Understanding the initial investments in existing hardware, facilities, and software. 

## 4.14 AWS Total Cost of Ownership Calculator 

•	AWS reduces TCO by providing pay-as-you-go model and reducing the need for large investment expenditures. 

•	Ability to estimate cost savings when using AWS providing summary reports which can be modified. 

## 4.16 What is AWS Organizations? 

•	Account management service that enables users to create and access AWS accounts which can be managed by the organization. 

## 4.17 Key Concepts of AWS Organizations 

“An organization has one master account along with zero or more member accounts. You can organize the accounts in a hierarchical, tree-like structure with a root at the top and organizational units nested under the root. Each account can be directly in the root or placed in one of the OUs in the hierarchy.”

- Root - acts a parent container for all accounts and applies policies to all units if added to root. 

- OU - Organization Unit can contain other OU’s and can have only one parent root. 

- Account – contains AWS resources and there are only two types a master account and member accounts which contain its own capabilities. 

- Invitations & Handshakes are features that allow accounts to connect and work together. 

## 4.21 Introducing Billing and Cost management
•	AWS had a feature for Billing and Cost Management which allows for paying AWS bill, monitor usage, and analyze and control costs. 
•	Graphs include spend summary and both month-to-date spend by service and top services by spend. 
•	Features within this service allow to estimate and plan AWS costs, receive alerts for exceeding costs or usage, assess investments, and simplify accounting. 
## 4.22 Cost explorer
•	Cost explorer is a free tool and easy to use allowing for viewing of charts, forecasts, and discovery of pending and usage patterns. 
## 4.23 AWS Budgets

•	Allows users to access cost visualizations through “Cost Explorer” to show budget statuses and create notifications. 

## 4.25 AWS Support Services 

•	There are four levels of support which ranges from Basic, Developer, Business, and Enterprise support plans. 

•	There are “Trusted Advisors” for the ability to increase performance and help get the best practices. A customized cloud expert that checks for opportunities to reduce costs and increase productivity. 

## Questions: 

What kind of default reports are available? 

Can I save custom AWS Cost explorer report?
