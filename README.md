4.01 Introduction 

•	Amazon Web Service’s ability to offer on-demand and pay-as-you-go payment model creates the ability to compete and optimize costs for it’s users. 

4.02 How do you pay for AWS? 

•	Pay-as-you-go pricing is similar to the way many people pay for home utilities like water and electricity where consumers pay for only the for the amount of resources used within a time frame. 

•	Advantage one is the ability to be adaptable with changes within a business without having to over commit to budgets and not missing capacity. 

•	Advantage two is that companies and users may focus on the things that matter such as innovation and invention rather than having to worry about over provisioning. 

•	Advantage three is that you can pay less with using more as there are discounts for increased usage. 

•	Advantage four is that users may invest in reserved capacity; these instances are AURI, PURI, & NURI. (All Upfront Reserved Instance, Partial Upfront Reserved Instance, No Upfront Reserved Instance)

4.03 Key Principles of Pricing

•	Three fundamental drivers of AWS costs are Compute, Storage, Outbound data transfer. 

•	AWS offers pricing models like:
    o	“On demand” pay for compute or database capacity with no long term commitments.

    o	“Dedicated Instances “  run in a virtual private cloud on single customer hardware.

    o	“Spot Instances” Amazon EC2 pricing mechanism letting users purchase spare computing capacity with no upfront                payment. 

    o	“Reservations” opportunity to receive greater discount by paying ahead of time for capacity.
